# NgTesting

**NgTesting** is a robust Angular application designed to facilitate the testing of components, services, and directives in a real-world scenario, showcasing various testing methodologies commonly used in Angular development.

## Overview

**NgTesting** serves as an educational tool and reference project for developers looking to enhance their skills in Angular testing practices. The application includes a variety of components and services to demonstrate unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. By providing practical examples, this project helps users understand the best practices for testing in Angular, ensuring code quality and maintainability.

## Features

- **Component Testing**: Demonstrates how to test Angular components, including input/output bindings and lifecycle hooks.
- **Service Testing**: Showcases how to test Angular services, ensuring that business logic functions correctly.
- **Directive Testing**: Provides examples of testing custom directives to verify their functionality.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Implements end-to-end tests using a chosen framework to simulate user interactions and verify overall application functionality.
- **Code Coverage**: Configured to provide code coverage reports to assess the effectiveness of tests.
- **Responsive Design**: Includes responsive components to demonstrate testing on various screen sizes.

## Development Server

To start a development server, run the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

To generate a new component, use the following command:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

You can also generate other Angular constructs with the commands below:

```bash
ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module
```

## Build

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. You can serve this directory with a static server or deploy it to a web hosting service.

## Running Unit Tests

Execute the unit tests with the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

This will run the tests using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) as the test runner. You can configure the test runner and the test framework according to your needs.

### Code Coverage

To check the code coverage of your tests, run:

```bash
ng test --code-coverage
```

This will generate a coverage report in the `coverage/` directory, providing insights into how much of your code is tested.

## Running End-to-End Tests

To run end-to-end tests, first ensure you have installed a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities, such as Protractor. Then, use the following command:

```bash
ng e2e
```

This command will run end-to-end tests, simulating user interactions and verifying that the application behaves as expected.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows Angular's best practices:

```
src/
|-- app/
|   |-- components/
|   |-- services/
|   |-- directives/
|   |-- models/
|-- assets/
|-- environments/
|-- main.ts
|-- index.html
|-- styles.css
```

- **app/**: Contains the main application code, including components, services, and directives.
- **assets/**: Holds static assets such as images, fonts, and other resources.
- **environments/**: Contains configuration files for different environments (development, production).
